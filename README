LAST UPDATED:  July 8, 2012

so it appears that I should use the following files:

ekb_ftp_rsync.sh   at least every 2 weeks.  It doesn't take long to run, so I can probably run it more frequently.  

backup_rsync.sh     
	this runs backup and migrate and then rsyncs the bam directory on the server with my local computer.  
	Lastly, it takes the an rsync of the files on my 1st hard drive and then does an rsync to the second hard drive.

NEXT STEPS:
*****************

Let's change the directory on backup_rysync.sh to somewhere besides the desktop


Also, let's create a proper SQL dump script using drush. It looks like I started one, but I can't remmeber what problems I had with it


Also, want to explore the issue with the 2nd harddrive.  see the messages below
